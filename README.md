# 👶 Who Am I?

Once upon a time, a **baby boy from Kathmandu** stared at a computer and said,  
> _"Someday, I’ll break it... and fix it better."_ 💥🛠️

Fast forward ⏩ — I’m **Xitiz Basnet**, a curious human with big dreams and slightly bigger monitors.

# 👋 Hello, I'm **Xitiz Basnet**

> 👨‍💻 System Administrator & IT Researcher blending tech, cloud, and humor — one secure connection at a time. 🔐🌐😄

🎓 MBA in HR | BCS in Computer Science  
📍 Based in Kathmandu, Nepal  
🔍 Currently exploring **PhD opportunities** in cutting-edge IT domains.  
😄 Once a baby boy curious about wires — now a man who tames servers like pets

🌍 Trying to balance `ping`, `break`, `fix`, `repeat` with cups of coffee ☕
